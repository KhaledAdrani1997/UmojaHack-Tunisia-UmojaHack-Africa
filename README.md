# UmojaHack-Tunisia-UmojaHack-Africa
Well, I participated as a part of a team. We worked together to solve the given problem. 

We made many submissions. My submission was not the best by any mean (it scored 0.201218...) while our best submission scored 0.124707... .

We got the 12th rank out of 135 teams and participants in the leaderboard. We did not win but we learnt a lot of things!

# What will you find in this repository?

I'm still a novice in Deep Learning and I just started learning! Naturally, since last year, I focused mainly on Machine Leanring.

The Repository will contain for now my notebook, including my humble model.

It is almost no different from the Deep Learning Starter Notebook of the competition. I added a sequential layer and convolutional layer with some tweaking 
to other parameters. I did not change any embeddings.






# So

This is just one step among many in my journey.
